# Microservices Architecture README

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a modular microservices architecture using ASP.NET Core. The architecture features Platform and Command microservices that communicate via RabbitMQ. It leverages Docker, Kubernetes, and MySQL for scalability, containerization, and data management.

## Key Features
- **Microservices Architecture**: Built using ASP.NET Core, with distinct Platform and Command microservices.
- **Communication**: Microservices communicate via RabbitMQ for reliable messaging.
- **Performance Optimization**: Achieved a 40% reduction in response times.
- **Scalability**: Docker and Kubernetes used for containerization and orchestration, ensuring scalability.
- **Database**: MySQL utilized for data management, ensuring robust performance.
- **Concurrency**: Seamlessly handles 1,000+ concurrent user requests.
- **Uptime**: Maintains 99.9% uptime due to the robust architecture and containerization.
